Hello all o/

Today I have released `pyClocks v1.1` for Windows and Linux!

After v1.1 release, which took my whole free time for 2 days, I feel it is finally an MVP product. I still have a lot to do, to be sure that pyClocks is ready product but I'm on the right tracks :)

Check it out and feel free to write me a feedback / report issues directly on pyClcoks github
