Hello all o/

Yesterday I have released `pyClocks v1.0` for Windows and Linux!

What a feeling, to have application released.
It's not yet in final form, but I decided to name version `v1.0`, as it is my first time relasing something on my own, and that's quite nice feeling.

Check it out and feel free to write me a feedback / report issues directly on pyClcoks github
